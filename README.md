Sure, here's a basic README for your `ChromeDriverManager` class:

# ChromeDriverManager

**ChromeDriverManager** is a Python class designed to simplify the installation and updating process of the ChromeDriver executable, which is essential for automating Google Chrome browser tasks using Selenium.

## Installation

You can install `ChromeDriverManager` via pip. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/iamseyedalipro/chromeDriverManager.git
```

## Usage

To use `ChromeDriverManager`, simply call its `install` method. This method orchestrates the entire installation process, ensuring that the latest version of ChromeDriver is downloaded and installed.

```python
from ChromeDriverManager import ChromeDriverManager

# Instantiate the ChromeDriverManager
manager = ChromeDriverManager()

# Install ChromeDriver
chromedriver_path = manager.install()

# Now you can use chromedriver_path to set up your Selenium WebDriver
```
